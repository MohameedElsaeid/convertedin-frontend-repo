      },
      {
        "question": "What am I charged for?",
        "answer": "You only pay for the clicks and calls that your ads get. You aren't charged for impressions. The cost of each click or call depends on many factors, like how often people are looking for businesses like yours, and how many competing businesses have ads. Although costs vary, you’re never charged more than your monthly budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why can't I find my ad in search results?",
        "answer": "If your dashboard shows your campaign is active, and you're getting clicks and impressions, your ad is showing to customers. Your budget, website quality, ad quality, location settings, and keyword themes all determine when and where your ad shows."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do my ads show?",
        "answer": "Your ads show on Google Search, Maps, Gmail, and on Google partner websites. We show your ads in different places to get you the best results possible."
